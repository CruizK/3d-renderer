# graphics-project

## How to run
1. Make Build Directory in root folder (`mkdir build && cd build`)
2. Run `cmake ../`
3. If on windows, will create a VS project called Sandbox you can build and run (Make sure to set Sandbox as startup project)
4. If on linux, will create a makefile, just run `make -j` and run with `./Sandbox`
5. You will have to copy the "res" folder into the build directory in order for it to load resources properly
